# pokemon_battle_sim
A pokemon battle simulator limited in scope to Gen 1 Pokemon, using most of the modern mechanics, except abilities.

The goal of this project is to become more familiar with the Rust programming language.

At the same time, I'm aiming to implement most of the behavior of the battles within the games, 
while limiting Pokemon available to those of generation one. Movepools will likely be obtained from Smogon for simplicity.
